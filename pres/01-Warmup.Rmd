## Warm up:  Mental game

-   You really really want to believe that the code you wrote is good
-   You don't know when you'll be done, your boss is waiting, your client is paying
-   You feel like an imposter because it "should be easy"
-   You catch yourself just staring at the screen, you're not even thinking anymore
-   Or you're thinking hard, but you don't really know what you're thinking about

## Warm up:  Technical debt 

-   Cost of taking shortcuts or making compromises
    -   Tight project deadlines,
    -   Lack of resources
    -   Inexperience
    -   Devs just wanna have fun ?
    - ...

Refactoring = investment to reduce technical debt 

(and recover your sanity)
